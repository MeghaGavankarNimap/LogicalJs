Constructor: This is the first method called when an instance of the component is created. 


ngOnInit:
Purpose: Called once after the component is initialized.
Use Cases: Typically used for initialization tasks, such as fetching initial data or setting up subscriptions.


ngDoCheck: This hook is called during every change detection cycle. It's not necessarily called immediately 
after ngOnInit but can be triggered multiple times during the component's lifecycle.
