private key and public key exchnage among the parties
sender will encrypt the data and receiver will decrypt the data
private key is with issuer nd public key i swith subscriber.
CryptoJS.aes256,DES,HmacSHA256,HmacSHA224,HDS etc


if(action==e){

}


secretKey: A private key used for encryption and decryption.
secretIv: An initialization vector used to add an extra layer of security during encryption.
encryptMethod: Specifies the encryption algorithm and key size (AES-256-CBC in this case).

method(data,action){
    if(action==e){
      const cipher=CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data,key,{
        iv,encryptMethod
      })
      return {key:cipher.tostring()}

    }

SHA algorithm
original data+hash function==hash value/digest
we use hash function to convert input into hask digest and here using SHA hash algorithm.

Secure Hash algorithm:
NSA & NIST joint development
Has multiple families such as SHA-0,SHA-1,SHA-2,SHA-3 
SHA-2 familiy has same hash function with diffent block size namely SHA-256 ans SHA-512,SHA 256 uses 32 bit words and 512 uses 64 bit words.
Length of the original message should be less than 2^64 bit for SHA-1 nad SHA 256.

1 byte=8 bit
Each character is 16bit that is 2 byte.
The length of diget is always 160 bits in length.
origialmessage+padding bits(addition data to make multiple of 512)=total length to be 64 bits less than multiple of 512.
eg. if you have a 400-bit message, you need to add 112 bits of padding to make it 512 bits.
5 buffers(to stores data) are used of 32 bits each.
They are 5 words named  A,B,C,D,E.
the first iteration has fixed hexadecimal values.
