dialoge.afterclosed=used when data in dialogbox want and to display
dialoge.closed=used when only dialog box has to be closed.

Datasource=it is used to manage and display data in various Angular components, such as tables (e.g., <mat-table>)
by using datasource we can use pagination,filtering,sorting

sorting
To add sorting behavior to the table, add the matSort directive to the table and add mat-sort-header to each column header cell that should trigger sorting. 
mat-sort-header in Angular Material allows users to sort data in both ascending and descending order by clicking on the column header.

skip(1)=will skip selected value,here 1
distinctUntilChanged=emit only distinct or unique value
take(1)= Take only the first emitted value

Difference in view child and output dec
both are used to access child into parent but the difference is @Output is used for sending events from child to parent, while @ViewChild is used for accessing child components or DOM elements in the parent component.
so basically in outpt we can tahe events or fun from child or custome logic and can change that logic further in parent.



difference in ngoninit and ngafterviewinit
In summary, ngOnInit is called when the component and its inputs/properties are ready, but the view is not fully constructed, whereas ngAfterViewInit is called after the view is fully constructed and rendered
